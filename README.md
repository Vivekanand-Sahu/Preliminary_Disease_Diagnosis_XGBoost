# Preliminary Disease Diagnosis XGBoost


## I analyzed and pre-processed symptoms data using one-hot encoding and normalization to improve model performance. Then, I trained an XGBoost model, fine-tuning parameters like ‘max-depth’ and ‘subsample,’ achieving an F1 score of 0.78 for disease prediction. This helped in reducing patient wait times by 30%. Finally, I displayed real-time disease prediction statistics to doctors through a Tableau dashboard, enabling quick and informed decision-making.
